# Old-Glory

This is an Objective-C developers try at solving a simple layout problem in order to practice some Swift. 

The problem is simple, draw the American flag, otherwise know as 'Old Glory' using UIKit. 

CSS techniques provide the template of the solution, for simplicity an image is allowed for the star. Wherever a chance has presented itself to take advantage of new Swift language features e.g. extensions, they've been taken.

If you're interested in trying out your own solution first [usflag.org](http://www.usflag.org/flagspecs.html "Old Glory") should be quite useful for understanding how to acquire an accurate layout.
